# Understanding App Router

A comprehensive guide to modern web development tools and practices, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This project serves as an interactive learning platform showcasing different aspects of web development.

## Features

- **Next.js Guide**: Detailed exploration of Next.js features and capabilities
- **Tailwind CSS Examples**: Comprehensive showcase of Tailwind CSS styling and components
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with interactive cards and hover effects
- **Custom Fonts**: Integration of Google Fonts (Instrument Serif, Roboto, and more)
- **Icon Integration**: Using FontAwesome icons for enhanced visual experience

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- FontAwesome Icons
- Google Fonts

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.
